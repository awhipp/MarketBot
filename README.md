# MarketBot
This is an open source Android application that allows the user to search the market, along with buy and sell orders. 

It is quick and responsive, so you don't have to worry about that slow SDE bloating the APK. 

I used Android Material design standards and made sure it uses as many transitions as possible to make it a smooth and enjoyable experience. 

Make sure to tap on the market orders, because they open to give you more info, like range and location.

# Future
I have also been working on adding it a "bot" feature that tracks specific items in specific regions of space and notify you when the price of buy or sell orders pass your threshold. Along with that I added network caching so you can still use quite a bit of it in offline mode, and working on building it into the database so it if quicker and requires internet only for specific calls to update info or ones not stored.
